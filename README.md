Intro
-----
Greed is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin. Greed has a rapidly changing Proof of Work and Proof of Stake system, and it's first goal is to test an evolving POS system and observe it's effects on the blockchain and in the altcoin marketplace.

Greed is built on the foundation of Positron, with a modified reward system.

Short: GREED

Algorithm SHA256


RPC Port: 26925

P2P Port: 26926

60 Seconds Per Block

100 Blocks to Confirm

20MB Blocksize

Block Reward Schedule - Proof of Work Phase
-------------------------------------------
**Block 1-2**

    5 GREED

**Block 3 to 1999**

    0 GREED - ANTI INSTAMINE - (sha256 diff adjustment period)

**Block 2000 to 2090**

    1 GREED
    
**Block 2091 to 2101**

    1 GREED
    
**Block 2102 to 3500**

    .01 GREED
	
**Block 3501 to 10999**

    0 GREED
    

Proof of Work rejected after block 10999

Total approx potential coins from POW: **~124 GREED TOTAL**.
